#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Gym log is an application ment to keep track of previous workouts.
This is done by creating custom templates, which contain different exercises.
When starting a workout, you will be prompted to update the values of repetitions and weight.
These updated values will then be showed the next time you start the same template/workout.
All templates are stored as csv-files, in the same directory as the project.py file.
